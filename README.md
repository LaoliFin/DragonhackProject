PROBLEM: 
Have you heard someone say: “Slovenians are cold people?” Well, 25% of the students on this University are foreigners, and they think that’s true. After an informal analysis we realized one of their biggest problem is social life integration.

SOLUTION:
A web app that will offer foreign students insider info on the best local places, activities and parties, while teaching them phrases like “” and songs like “”, or letting them know they have to try a potica. Besides the blog, users can make a profile where they will share their social media to connect with locals, save places, events or recipes, leave reviews. 

Possible scaling?
- Places and organizators will pay us to promote their place or their event
- Growth: making it for all student towns in Slovenia -> Connection with Erasmus or similar networks -> Scaling it for more student towns in Europe

APIs:
- Spotify API
- Google maps API
- Slovenian websites APIs
