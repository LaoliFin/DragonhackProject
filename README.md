# DragonhackProject

A website called "HowToSlovenc" which helps foreign students integrate in the social life of Ljubljana. 
Our two target groups are Slovenians that are extroverted and like to help, and first year foreign students that are looking for new friendships and knowledge.
HowToSlovenc has four main features: Events, music and language.
EVENTS: web scraped from a website called allevents.in that has all of the student parties posted (would be ideally with an API in the future but there wasn't one on pages that include Slovenia's events)
MUSIC: With the help of Spotify and our Editor's pick, we will share playlists of the most listened Slovenian songs, where users can give their suggestions and comments, and add new playlists.
LANGUAGE: Users can play language games like guess the translation of the Slovenian phrase, where they can learn useful everyday phrases.

My profile: For changing an username and a caption, that would include the users social media accounts for further connection
